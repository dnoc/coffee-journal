# Coffee Journal

This is a little side project webapp that I started to learn a few new things and get experience outside my day-to-day work.
I wanted to learn how to use SvelteKit, how to create a progressive webapp, how to use Github Copilot, how to use TailwindCSS, get more practice with css animations, and how to use a different backend than I'm used to (currently wip Supabase).

- [x] Timeline navigation and display
- [x]  Nav and background styling
- [ ] Mobile nav buttons
- [x] Form as a drawer
- [ ] Form input styling
- [x] Timeline animations
- [ ] Funky little animations everywhere
- [x] Downloadable as a PWA
- [ ] Form saves log to a backend
- [ ] Timeline actually displays saved logs from the user
- [ ] Calendar view
- [ ] Profile, display and editable

## create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
